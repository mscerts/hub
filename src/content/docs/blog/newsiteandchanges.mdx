:::tip[Hello World!]
It's your local friendly contributor **nighthouse** here again, and while it's been a while since our last blog post. We have some awesome news to share with you all regarding all the recent changes made on the Hub!

As you can tell, we recently migrated to a new domain along with a complete overhaul of the website. The new domain is [msfthub.com](https://msfthub.com) and we have redesigned the site to provide a better user experience. We hope you like the new look and feel of the site and as always, if you find a bug or have any suggestions please feel free to drop them in our Discord server and you can always ping me directly (@nighthouse).

Moreover we have also added several new voucher offers for you to take advantage of.
