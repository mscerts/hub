## New AI Certifications in Beta 

<img src="/aiexams.png" alt="AI business exams"/>

While not much is known about these certifications yet, Microsoft has announced a few new certifications that are currently in beta status. These certifications revolve around the use of Copilot in Microsoft products and services. These certifications include:

- AB-100: Microsoft Agentic AI Business Solutions Architect (beta)
- AB-730: Microsoft AI Business Professional (beta)
- AB-731: Microsoft AI Transformation Leader (beta)
- AB-900: Microsoft 365 Copilot and Agent Administration Fundamentals (beta)

As is with beta exams, these is a limited time offer for the first 300 candidates to the exams with a 80% discount voucher. More details can be found on the [beta exam page](/vouchers/betaexams/)

## Dynamic Exams Re-added

We'd like to also announce that Dynamic exams are back on the site thanks to the work of [Carlos Richard Geraldine](https://github.com/carlosrichardgeraldine) who recently put in the work and sent in the PRs to bring them back.

While they were removed previously due to a lack of interest, we hope that with the recent changes to the site more people will be interested in contributing to them. If you have any dynamic exams that you would like to add please feel free!
