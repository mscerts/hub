      Official Microsoft Practice tests. They are expensive but they will prepare you for the exam. They are harder than normal exam questions but that helps
      even more to identify your weak areas and where you need to study more. There are also cheaper assessments but they contain less questions and no explanations.

      MeasureUp also offers subscriptions in case you are planning to take multiple exams in the next 12 months.
