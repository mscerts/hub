<Aside type="danger" title="2024 July Update!">While this offer is available it no longer provides a free voucher for the foreseeable future.</Aside>

Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenge is a free and interactive program that provides access to Microsoft cloud technologies through a gamified experience utilizing Microsoft Learn content to assess and enhance participants' knowledge and skills in Microsoft cloud technologies. They involve completing tasks, solving problems, or answering quiz questions related to Azure, Microsoft 365, or other cloud platforms. These challenges provide practical learning opportunities and a chance to engage with the Microsoft community along with a free voucher for selected exams.
