title: 6. Taking the Exam
---

So, you have studied, ordered an exam and now the exam itself has started. Here is what you can expect.

**The tests themselves are divided into multiple sections - General questions, Case Studies and Labs**. You can't skip between them. Once you complete a section, you are unable to return to it.

Before you get to the actual exam questions, Microsoft will first ask you about your experience. This is not graded and it doesn't matter what you answer there.

After that you will be shown information about the exam itself. Be sure to read the total number of questions because sometimes you don't get a lab or case study at the beginning which means that you need to save time at the end for them.

Other useful information to know: On the bottom of page there are various tools that can help you

<img src="/public/examtools.webp" alt="Exam Tools">

Specifically, the **Calculator** and **Take a Break options**.

**Calculator** is useful when you need to count SLAs or other stuff that would take too long to do in your head.

**Take a Break** allows you to exit the room to go refresh or other stuff you forgot to do before an exam. After taking the break: **Timer will continue and you won't be able to return to any of the previous questions.** So, cheating won't help you.

**On the top side:**

<img src="/public/examtools2.webp" alt="Exam tools again">

First on the left is **Review** button. You can use it to navigate between the questions easily.

Then there is **Review later** box. If you aren't sure about your answer, you can toggle this and return to it from the Review screen if you have extra time.

**Leave Feedback** is not that important. If you toggle this on questions, you can then tell Microsoft when you finish the exam how bad the question was. Not relevant to the exam.

And lastly on the right, is the timer. **This timer tracks only the current section**, so if you see there are 38 questions in total on there, that means for the current section. If there is lab or case study outside it is only mentioned on the Welcome to the exam page at the start. So don't be surprised when you finish and there is still a case study or lab waiting for you.

**There are 3 requirements that are always present in exams and required**:

* **Solution must be as cheap as possible**
* **Administrative role must be of the least privilege**
* **Must be the simplest to implement**

**Here are the question types (you can find most of these in the exam demo simulating how the real exam looks like,** [**https://aka.ms/examdemo**](https://aka.ms/examdemo)**):**

[**Active Screen**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#active-screen-044)**/**[**Best answer**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#best-answer-020)**/**[**Multiple Choice**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#multiple-choice-037): I grouped these together because the strategy is the same. Choose the best answer. You can usually discard 2 answers because you either haven't heard of it or you know it is wrong. So, you are left with 50/50 choice. If you feel like both are correct, think of the more elegant solution. Abide by the 3 rules I mentioned in bold earlier.

[**Hot Area/Active Screen**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#hot-area-017): It can be screenshot of basically any menu or portal that is related to the exam. AAD Connect configuration, home of azure portal, creating VM for example. Your task will be to answer the question by toggling option/s in the screenshot.

It is really useful to know the menu you are interacting with and not going in blind.

[**Drag and Drop**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#drag-and-drop-037): As the name says, pretty self-explanatory. Drag an answer from left to right.

Usually there aren't more of the same answers on the right so if you have 3 on the left and 3 on the right and have no idea, there is a good chance that all answers will be used once.  **That isn't the case with some questions** but most I encountered used this pattern.

<img src="/public/draganddrop.webp" alt="Drag and Drop">

**The question types below will only appear in non-fundamental exams.**

[**Build List**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#build-list-045): Similar to the Drag and Drop, but now you are making a list. So, you will also need to order it correctly. **Don't forget about the basics**, like resource providers in PowerShell or create resource button in Azure Portal.

<img src="/public/buildlist.webp" alt="Build List">

[**Repeated answer choices**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#repeated-answer-choices-020): Probably the strangest and most confusing question type you will encounter if you haven't heard about it yet. You will be presented with one scenario. There will be a possible solution and you will be asked if it is a **full** solution to the scenario and problem. There will be multiple questions presenting the same scenario but different solutions. **After answering the question, you may not return to it.** There are usually around 4 questions in a scenario.

The strategy here is simple, if you aren't **100%** sure, pick **false**. There are 3 patterns, there either isn't presented correct answer, there is only one and there are 2. From my own experience the chance there are 2 answers is really low. So statistically it is best to always pick false unless you are sure it is correct.

[**Simulations/Labs**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#labs-258): You will enter a virtual environment and will have to complete a series of tasks there. You are scored both on completeness of the solution **and** how effective you were at it. Once you turn it in, you can't return to it.

So randomly clicking through blades until you find the one with the setting in it, is not recommended. Labs take longer to score so you will not receive your score immediately.

[**Case Studies**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exam-duration-question-types#case-studies-113): You will be shown a screen with a lot of tabs and screens with tons of information in them. The important thing here: **Don't read it all!**  The first screen doesn't contain the question, so you will have to go to the next one. Only after reading the question, start going through the relevant materials.

<img src="/public/casestudies.webp" alt="Case Studies">

After you finish all your questions in the section, you will be presented with the Review screen (also accessible from the top tool bar)

<img src="/public/reviewscreen.webp" alt="Review Screen">

This doesn't necessarily mean it is the end of the exam as there may be case study or lab after. Here you can see how you and can easily access questions you didn't answer or marked for review. **Always answer all questions, even if you have no clue. You don't get negative points for guessing. If you finish the review screen and there are still unanswered questions, you've done it wrong.**

After finishing the whole exam, it still isn't over. Once you get to this window and don't want to leave feedback to the questions (or are just really anxious about how you did). **Ignore it. In the bottom right there is Exit button.**

<img src="/public/questionfeedbackscreen.webp" alt="Question Feedback Screen">

This will take you to the result page (if you had a lab, you won't get your result immediately).

<img src="/public/resultscreen.webp" alt="Result Page">

On the next page you will see your score report (no need to read it now, can access it from PearsonVue later on. And only once you hit the End button there, you finished the exam.

**This is especially important when taking a test from home so you don't get failed for leaving the screen before this.**
