* Each tile contains a different certification.
* Under the certification you can see the exam/s required to get it.
* By clicking on the certification name, you will be directed into the certification webpage.
* After clicking the exam name, you will be directed into the exam webpage.
* The star symbol in the top right indicates it is an expert level certification
* The lock symbol in the bottom right indicates there is a prerequisite certification you must hold to be able to get this certification. You can still take the exams, you just won't receieve a certification until the prerequisite is met. 

I will use the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290) as an example. As you can see in this image:

(You can find this on every certification page), you need to:

* Complete one prerequisite certification in this case, the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290&practice-assessment-type=certification)

 **AND**

* Pass the [AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions Exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/exams/az-305/?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290)

After that you will then receive the Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert Certification.

:::tip 
To pass an exam you need 70% of the total score so your score can't be lower than 700/1000. Scoring is individual and depends on the question set you receive. If you want to get familiar with the testing process, it is thoroughly described in this post: [**How to take Microsoft Exams**](/guide/takingtheexams/).
:::

## There are 4 certification types in total:

* **Fundamentals (1 star)**
* **Associate (2 star)**
* **Expert (3 star)**
* **Specialty**

### Fundamentals

* Fundamental certifications consist of entry level exams in their respective areas. Their content is usually learning how does the respective area work, what are the important products/concepts and what is their purpose. These certifications are aimed at non-technical people (Sales Associates, Managers, Executives or Students) and people trying to enter Microsoft Cloud before they start with the harder exams.
* When taking the exam, you will have 45 minutes for the exam itself + 20 minutes where you will have to read non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and go through questionnaires.

:::note 
Fundamental certifications are good for life and will never expire, even when the exam/certification is retired with the only exception being GitHub certifications which are valid for 2 years only.
:::

### Associate

* Associate certifications are very technical certifications that require a deep knowledge of the technologies. They are aimed at professionals who want to certify their skills with the products.
* When taking the exam, you will have 100 minutes (if it contains a lab, you get 120 minutes) + 20 minutes where you will have to read NDA and go through questionnaires.
* Associate certifications have to be renewed every year. The renewal process is described here: [**Certification Renewal**](https://certs.msfthub.wiki/guide/certificationrenewal/).
:::caution
Associate exams fall under role-based exam type which means they are meant to certify skills and knowledge of the products for people who actively work with them. 

The exams don't test your ability to learn a course like exams in schools do but actual skills so unless you are a working professional, these exams might be very hard to prepare for and pass. 
:::

### Expert

* Expert certifications are a mix of technical and architectural content and are almost impossible to pass without hands-on experience. You will be expected to know all of the relevant products, how they work, differences between similar products, SKUs and basic knowledge of how to use the products and how they work with each other. They are aimed at people who already feel really comfortable in the cloud.
* Expert certifications have to be renewed every year. The renewal process is described here: [**Certification Renewal**](https://certs.msfthub.wiki/guide/certificationrenewal/).
:::caution
Expert exams fall under role-based exam type which means they are meant to certify skills and knowledge of the products for people who actively work with them. 

The exams don't test your ability to learn a course like exams in schools do but actual skills so unless you are a working professional, these exams might be very hard to prepare for and pass. 
:::

### Specialty

* Specialty certifications are purely concentrated around the product in their name. They are a mix of high level and technical knowledge and require a really good understanding of it and how it fits in with Microsoft Cloud.
* Specialty certifications have to be renewed every year. The renewal process is described here: [**Certification Renewal**](https://certs.msfthub.wiki/guide/certificationrenewal/).
:::caution
Specialty exams fall under role-based exam type which means they are meant to certify skills and knowledge of the products for people who actively work with them.
