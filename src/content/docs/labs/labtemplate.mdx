  <TabItem label="Microsoft Learn">

:::note 
Microsoft Learn sandboxes are interactive, temporary environments provided by Microsoft Learn that allow users to practice and explore Azure services and other Microsoft technologies without needing their own subscription. These sandboxes are free, time-limited, and isolated, offering a secure space to complete guided learning modules, tutorials, and hands-on exercises in a real-world setup.

Rarely, they require you to bring your own subscription or run the exercises locally on your computer.
:::
:::caution 
Be careful of starting multiple sandboxes/visiting multiple sandbox URLs as Microsoft Learn might suspend your access due to detected suspicious activity.

  <TabItem label="Microsoft GitHub">

:::note 
Microsoft GitHub labs are series of labs designed to be used in Microsoft Instructor Lead Trainings delivered by Microsoft Certified Trainers where participants also have access to the environment to perform them. This means that for everyone else, it is necessary to bring your own environment to go through them.
