<img src="https://www.microsoft.com/cloudskillschallenge/images/Trophy_CSC%20-%20128%20px.png" width="60" height="60" class="center">

Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenge is a free and interactive program that provides access to Microsoft cloud technologies through a gamified experience utilizing Microsoft Learn content to assess and enhance participants' knowledge and skills in Microsoft cloud technologies. They involve completing tasks, solving problems, or answering quiz questions related to Azure, Microsoft 365, or other cloud platforms. These challenges provide practical learning opportunities and a chance to engage with the Microsoft community along with a free voucher for selected exams.

## [Microsoft Build](https://aka.ms/buildcsc) (100% Discount Voucher)

Microsoft Build usually happens in **Spring (March/June)**. Historically the event ends with a Cloud Skills Challenge.

- You enter the challenge and will have the option to complete one of the predetermined learning paths. You don't actually need to read those or answer the questions correctly at the end of modules, so if you don't have much time you can skip through the content and read it during your preparation later.
- As always there is a select date on which you'll get a voucher after you complete all the modules in a specific challenge. **You will not instantly recieve a voucher upon finishing your modules.**
- The voucher is usually **valid for the next 3 months**, after that you will be unable to reschedule it any further *(it is the final deadline)* and you can only use the voucher code for the exams that are **eligible for that specific challenge event** (but can complete any challenge and take any of the eligible exams).
- In the past vouchers were universal which meant you can use them with any exam, that has changed since Build 2021. You will now only recieve one voucher that is only applicable to the exams listed in the event details. **However you can do any challenge & apply your voucher to any of the allowed exams.**

## [Microsoft Ignite](https://aka.ms/ignitecsc) (100% Discount Voucher)

Microsoft Ignite takes place in **Fall (October/November)**. Historically the event ends with a Cloud Skills Challenge just like Build.

- You enter the challenge and will have the option to complete one of the predetermined learning paths. You don't actually need to read those or answer the questions correctly at the end of modules, so if you don't have much time you can skip through the content and read it during your preparation later.
- As always there is a select date on which you'll get a voucher after you complete all the modules in a specific challenge. **You will not instantly recieve a voucher upon finishing your modules.**
- The voucher is usually **valid for the next 3 months**, after that you will be unable to reschedule it any further *(it is the final deadline)* and you can only use the voucher code for the exams that are **eligible for that specific challenge event** (but can complete any challenge and take any of the eligible exams).
- In the past vouchers were universal which meant you can use them with any exam, that has changed since Ignite 2021. You will now only recieve one voucher that is only applicable to the exams listed in the event details. **However you can do any challenge & apply your voucher to any of the allowed exams.**

## [30 Days To Learn](https://aka.ms/30-days-to-learn-it) (50% Discount Voucher)

It is very similar to the normal cloud skills challenge from **Ignite** or **Build**.

Basically, you just go through MS Learn modules for a specific certification and after completing it, you get a **50% off** voucher. It isn't 100% but everything can help, especially since it includes a lot of exams. Offer just got extended to December 31st 2023.
